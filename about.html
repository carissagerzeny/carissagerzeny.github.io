My career objective is to fuse my love for music with my passion for digital media and marketing. I am enthusiastic about delivering creative talent to the interests of the right audience. I apply my ambitions to every situation, and am always actively finding ways to conquer the next challenge.My experience during my time as an undergraduate has focused on the music industry at record labels including Columbia Records and RED Distribution, and assisting in the start-up of the Universityâ€™s first record, Swamp Records. My duties at Columbia Records as a Publicity Intern included compiling press clippings and press packets on various artists, arranging phone conferences between members of the press and artists, mass mailings and press releases.

As an Intern with RED Distribution, I focused my efforts on creating artist awareness using promo tools and online marketing. In addition, I coordinated album reviews for my assigned artists with RED featured in print in <i>The Alligator</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>, as well as continuous communication with WRUF-FM for radio promotion. As the Assistant Head Director for Swamp Records, I designed a plan for a music showcase and an album release event. The purpose of initiating a student-run record label is to bridge the gap between Gainesville and the University music scenes.
